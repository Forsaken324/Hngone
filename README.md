# Number Classification API

## Overview
The Number Classification API is a RESTful service built using Fast API. It takes an integer as input and returns interesting mathematical properties along with a fun fact about the number.

## Features
- Determines if a number is prime
- Checks if a number is perfect
- Identifies Armstrong numbers
- Classifies numbers as odd or even
- Calculates the sum of digits
- Fetches a fun fact from the Numbers API

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Fast API
- Requests library
- Gunicorn


## API Endpoint

### Classify Number
- **URL:** `/api/classify-number`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameter:** `number` (required)

### Example Request
```bash
GET /api/classify-number?number=371
```

### Successful Response (200 OK)
```json
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
```

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)
```json
{
    "number": "alphabet",
    "error": true
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. Start the Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Deployment

1. **Choose a Deployment Platform:**  
   You can deploy the API on platforms like:
   - Railway
   - Render
   - Heroku
   - Vercel

2. **Prepare for Deployment:**  
   - Ensure all the packages in requirements.txt are installed
  

3. **Deploy:**  
   Follow the hosting platform’s guide to deploy Django applications.

4. **Verify Deployment:**  
   Ensure the API is publicly accessible and test using:
   ```bash
   curl <your-deployed-url>/api/classify-number?number=371
   ```

## Additional Notes
- The API handles only integer inputs. Non-integer values return a `400 Bad Request` error.
- Fast response times (< 500ms) are targeted for optimal performance.
- Ensure environment variables for deployment (like `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG`) are properly configured.
